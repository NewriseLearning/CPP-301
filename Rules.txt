- Only constant functions are callable in constant objects
- Constant functions cannot change object variables unless they are mutable
- Default constructor auto-generated for classes that has no constructors
- Copy constructor always auto-generated for classes that does not have copy constructor
- Classes using dynamic resources/memory must implement custom copy constructors
- Use destructor to release dynamic resources/memory per object
- Destructor is auto-generated generated for classes without destructor function
- Destructors should always be virtual in classes with virtual functions (polymorphic types)
- All auto-generated constructor/destructor are extended from base constructor/destructor
- Polymorphism only works using pointer/reference, does not work by value.
- Virtual functions are always called correctly everywhere except constructors.
- Constructors cannot call overriding functions in derived classes, only its own functions and base class functions.
